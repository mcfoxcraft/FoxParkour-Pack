# FoxParkour Pack (public distribution)

Public download mirror for the **Foxcraft parkour resource pack** — hats, plushies, balloons,
backpacks and offhand cosmetics. This repo holds **only the built pack zip**, published as GitHub
Releases so Minecraft clients can fetch it anonymously over GitHub's Fastly CDN.

The pack **source** (models, textures, sounds, item definitions, build tooling) lives in the
private `mcfoxcraft/FoxParkour-Resource-Pack` repo. Don't edit anything here by hand — releases are
produced from that source by `./release-pack.sh vX.Y.Z`.

## Current release

**[v1.7.1](https://github.com/mcfoxcraft/FoxParkour-Pack/releases/tag/v1.7.1)** — SHA-1
`c29407445489f4e55aa74e6bff820470618dda2f`

Adds the bard and assassin chestplates, leggings and boots (FoxGear's `foxgear:<set>/<tier>_<piece>` models
and their `foxgear:<set>_<tier>` equipment assets) for FoxParkour's body cosmetics. Bedrock is unchanged
(pack 1.5.0; armour shows as its material there). Otherwise unchanged from v1.7.0.

> **Do not point a live server at v1.0.0 on its own.** Cosmetics in this pack are addressed by the
> `minecraft:item_model` component, which only FoxParkour with
> [PR #909](https://github.com/mcfoxcraft/FoxParkour/pull/909) writes, and only when the live
> `cosmetics.yml` carries the `itemModel` keys. Pack, jar and config must land in the same restart —
> either half alone leaves cosmetics unresolved on 1.21.4+ clients.

`resource-pack-id` is deliberately **the same value oneblock uses**. With it blank, the client
derives a pack's identity from its URL, so parkour's pack and the Foxcraft pack land in different
slots and both stay loaded at once — a Bungee server switch never drops the previous server's pack.
Matching ids make each server's pack *replace* the other instead.
